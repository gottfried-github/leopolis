                      Up. One of the primary values of Leopolis Molodiy is encouraging young Ukrainians to use their minds to think about themselves, the world, and their core beliefs. Explore questions, such as: Why would a good God allow suffering? How do I set priorities? How do I have healthy friendships? How do science and faith relate to each other? Every Thursday our meetings involve some element of “UP” – either watching and discussing a film or exploring a meaningful theme together. We also have small groups, where students can know one another more closely and explore truth together. If you are interested in joining one of these groups, contact us at leopolisyouth@gmail.com.

                      Out.
                      At Leopolis we believe it is very important to help those who are in need and to take part in making L’viv a safer and more beautiful place to live. Because we believe that Jesus helped us when we were in need, we want to help others who are in need. In the past we have visited an orphanage, served the elderly, gathered money and goods for soldiers, cleaned trash from city parks, and gathered used paper to recycle. Since God created this world, we want to take care of it, and develop it into something wonderful and enjoyable for all.

                      FUN! As much as we value serious thinking, we also value fun together. Every month we plan events simply for the sake of providing students with time together, exciting opportunities, and rest from studies. Whether it is a fall costume party, building a gingerbread city, going bowling, or traveling to another city, we love time together. Besides our specific “IN” events, every Thursday that is not a Film Night we have quizzes, sing music, or play games. In short, if you want some good fun, come to Leopolis!
