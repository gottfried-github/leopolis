                      Up. One of the primary values of Leopolis Molodiy is encouraging young Ukrainians to use their minds to think about themselves, the world, and their core beliefs. Explore questions, such as: Why would a good God allow suffering? How do I set priorities? How do I have healthy friendships? How do science and faith relate to each other? Every Thursday our meetings involve some element of “UP” – either watching and discussing a film or exploring a meaningful theme together. We also have small groups, where students can know one another more closely and explore truth together. If you are interested in joining one of these groups, contact us at leopolisyouth@gmail.com.
